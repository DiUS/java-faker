          "My father taught me an important lesson many years ago. He said, 'Gwinlin, you have the whole world before you. Go out and experience it... be whatever you want to be.' So I took his advice, and here I am. This life might not look like much to you, but I'm content, and isn't that all that matters?",

          "I still don't know if there is a divine plan, but I've come to realize that it doesn't matter. What matters is that we act; that we do what's right when confronted with evil. That's what you did at Kvatch. It wasn't the gods that saved us, it was you.",
          "What a fool you are. I'm a god! How can you kill a god? How could you be so naive? What a grand and intoxicating innocence. There is no escape. No recall or intervention works in this place. Come, lay down your weapons. It is not to late for my mercy.",

          "Quiet, here comes the guard. You better do what they say.",
          "Do you get to the cloud district very often?",
          "Change will preserve us! It is the lifeblood of the world. It will move mountains! It will mount movements!",

          "Hey, there's my new pal! So what can I do for you? Need some items? Or maybe you ready to unload something? Whatever you need!",
          "Children, listen as the shadows cross your sleeping hutch, And the village sleeps away, streets emptied of the crowds, And the moons do balefully glare through the nightly clouds, And the graveyard's people rest, we hope, in eternal sleep, Listen and you'll hear the whispered tap of the footsteps creep, Then pray you'll never feel the Worm King's awful touch.",
          "He killed them! All of those people! We… we have to get him before he gets us! We have to kill that murdering swine!",
