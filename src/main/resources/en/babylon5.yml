         quotes: ['
"I was there, at the dawn of the Third Age of Mankind. It began in the
 Earth year 2257 with the founding of the last of the Babylon stations,
 located deep in neutral space.
 It was a port of call for refugees, smugglers, businessmen, diplomats
 and travelers from a hundred worlds. It could be a dangerous place, but
 we accepted the risk because Babylon 5 was our last, best hope for peace.
 Under the leadership of its final commander, Babylon 5 was a dream given
 form, a dream of a galaxy without war, where species from different worlds
 could live side-by-side in mutual respect, a dream that was endangered as
 never before by the arrival of one man on a mission of destruction.
      Babylon 5 was the last of the Babylon stations. This is its story."

"Babylons one, two and three were sabotaged and destroyed. Number
 four vanished without a trace 24 hours after becoming operational.
 To this day no one knows what happened to it."

"Notice the waves, each moving in its own order, predictable,
 unchanging. But drop in a single stone and see how the pattern
 changes. Everything around it is altered."

"On my world, there are books, thousands of pages, about the power of
 one mind to change the Universe, but none said it as clearly as this."
    -- Delenn to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"The Gathering"
','
"Do you not have files on the Vorlons?"
"Absolutely. Very large files. There''s nothing in them,
 of course. How much do *you* have?"
"More than you it would seem. Naturally it''s all classified."
"Naturally."

"Here is a copy of everything I have. It may be of use.
 If anyone asks, say it fell from the sky."

 clearly, you have not spent nearly enough time looking at it."

"Damn. You see, it''s your fault. You''re bad luck. I''ve always said
 that about him. Now, come on, come on. Look, you''re a security chief.
 Shouldn''t you be out *securing* something?"

','
"We have no telepaths among my people. A genetic oversight I suppose.
 One which you could help correct. I am empowered to compensate you
 quite handsomely for your genetic background."

 prefer conscious, but I don''t know what your .. pleasure threshold is."

"We were talking the other day about how nobody has seen a Vorlon before.
 And he said that according to legend, one human *did* see a Vorlon,
 and turned to stone."

"I suppose there''ll be a war now, hmm? All that running around and
 shooting at one another. You would''ve thought sooner or later it
 would go out of fashion."

','
"You make very good sharks, Mr. Garibaldi. We were pretty good sharks
 ourselves once, but somehow, along the way, we forgot how to bite.
 There was a time when this whole quadrant belonged to us. What are
 we now? Twelve worlds and a thousand monuments to past glories.
 Living off memories and stories, selling *trinkets*."

"Michael, I picked you because you are right for the job. You are not
 politicking, you are not subtle, and sometimes you are a pain in the
 ass. And I wouldn''t have it any other way."
    -- Sinclair to Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"The Gathering"
','
"We had to stop them, .. no matter what it cost. They came at us
 out of nowhere. We never had a chance. The sky was full of stars
 and every star an exploding ship -- one of ours."
    -- Sinclair about the Line in Babylon 5:"The Gathering"

"There we were, a fleet so large it nearly eclipsed the sun.
 Suddenly, we fell on them like a wave, foiling upon a shore--"
    -- Londo to Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"The Gathering"
','
"Delenn, just before he died, the Minbari assassin looked
 at me and said: ''There''s a hole in your mind.''"
"An old Minbari insult. Nothing you need worry about."

 stand ready to receive you. Babylon 5 is open for business."

','
"Commander, there''s a problem."
    -- LtCmdr. Susan Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"All I''m asking is that you trust me."
"Trust you? Londo, my brain will be five days dead before I ever trust a
 Centauri. The first time we met you people, the first time we met any other
 civilization, you told us you practically ran the entire galaxy."
    -- Londo and Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Appearances aside, we are two completely different species."
"A clerical error."
    -- Garibaldi and Londo in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Okay, we made a mistake. I''m sorry. Here, open my wrist."
"Centauri don''t have major arteries in their wrist."
"Of course we don''t. What do you think, I''m stupid?"
    -- Londo and Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"It was the Dawn of the Third Age of Mankind, ten years after the
Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal:
to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could
work out their differences peacefully. It''s a port of call, home away
from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. Humans
and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning
metal .. all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it''s our
last, best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon
stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5."
    -- Commander Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Your diligence is commendable. Anything else?"
"No, I just--"
"Then, if you''ll excuse me, but I''m in the middle of 15 things,
 all of them annoying. Thank you for coming by."
    -- Ivanova to Winters in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Not the Minbari, it''s not their way. They are too honorable to pull
 something like this."
"I''m surprised to hear you describe the Minbari that way. After all,
 you fought them during the war."
    -- Sinclair and Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"My father always told me: ''The best way to understand someone is to
 fight him, make him angry. That''s when you see the real person.''"
    -- Sinclair to Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"He taught me everything I know about flying, and combat. He said to ignore
 the propaganda, focus on what you see. I''ve never seen the Minbari fight
 dishonorably. They never pull a sneak attack."
    -- Sinclair to Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"So, who are you voting for?"
"I think I''ll vote for Marie Crane. .. I do not like Santiago. I always
 thought that a leader should have a strong chin. He has no chin and his
 vice-president has several. This, to me, is not a good combination."
    -- Sinclair and Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"You bastard! You won''t get away with this.
 We''ll strike back and we''ll strike back hard!"
    -- Londo to G''kar in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"The wheel turns, does it not, Ambassador?"
    -- G''Kar to Londo in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"We should''ve wiped out your kind when we had the chance."
"What happened? Run out of small children to butcher?"
    -- Londo and G''Kar in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Listen to me, Ambassador. Your time has come and gone. It''s our turn now!
 One night you''ll wake up and find our teeth at *your* throat. Sleep well,
 Ambassador. Sleep lightly."
    -- G''Kar to Londo in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"I apologize for the .. the incident with G''Kar, Commander. It was a
 mistake. *I* will not repeat it. I *will* kill him though. Sooner or
 later. Somewhere."
"Ambassador."
"My people.. We have a way you see. We know how, and sometimes even when,
 we are going to die. Comes in a dream. In my dream I am an old man, it''s
 20 years from now, and I *am* dying. My hands wrapped around someone''s
 throat, and his around mine. We have squeezed the life out of each other.
 The first time I saw G''Kar I recognized him as the one from the dream.
 It *will* happen. 20 years from now, we''ll die with hands around each
 others'' throats."
    -- Londo and Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Commander, please. On the issue of galactic peace, I''m long past innocence
 and fast approaching apathy. It''s all a game -- a paper fantasy of names
 and borders. Only one thing matters, Commander. Blood calls out for blood."
    -- Londo to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"If Carn is dead, there will be war. Today, tomorrow, the day after, it
 doesn''t matter. If it''s the last thing I do, if it''s the last breath I
 take, there will be war. This I swear to you, Commander. This I swear."
    -- Londo to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"You eat like a starving man."
"Seeing death has the way of doing that to me."
    -- Ivanova and Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"If you ask me, the universe is going to hell in a handbasket." 
    -- Garibaldi to Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"They are alone. They are a dying people. We should let them pass."
"Who? The Narn or the Centauri?"
"Yes."
    -- Kosh and Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Mr. Garibaldi, you are sitting in *my* station, using *my* equipment.
 Is there a reason for this, or to save time should I just go ahead and
 snap your hands off at the wrist?"
    -- Ivanova to Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"The Council, the Council can go to hell. And the emergency session
 can go to hell. And you, you can go to hell too. I wouldn''t want you
 to feel left out!"
    -- Londo to Vir Cotto in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Londo, Londo, *why* are you doing this?"
"Because, we are a race of lunatics and cowards."
    -- Vir and Londo in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Well, unlike me, the Lieutenant Commander takes a while
 to warm up to people, especially when she''s working."
    -- Garibaldi to Winters in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"I will confess that I look forward to the day when we have
 cleansed the Universe of the Centauri and carved their bones
 into little flutes for Narn children. It is a dream I have."
"Be careful, Ambassador. Not every dream I''ve heard lately
 ends well for you."
    -- G''Kar and Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"We''ve had plenty of experience with sneak attacks. Pearl Harbor, the
 terrorists'' nuking of San Diego, the destruction of our first Mars colony.
 It''s a long and bloody history. Do you know what we learned from it?
 That a sneak attack is the first resort of a coward."
    -- Sinclair to G''Kar in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"What''s wrong, Ambassador? Don''t have the guts for a fair fight?"
    -- Sinclair to G''Kar in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"The Earth Alliance can''t go around being the galaxy''s policemen."
    -- The Senator to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"To start a war over blood spilled so long ago.. Where does it end?
 You kill them and take their land. They kill you and take the land
 back. On and on and on. The cycle of hatred."
"*Justice*, not hatred. We have no desire to start a war."
    -- Delenn and G''Kar in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Mr. Garibaldi! Just now, would you really have killed *me*?"
"Yes. Yes, I would''ve, but I''m just as glad I didn''t have to.
 The paperwork''s a pain in the butt."
    -- Londo and Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Perhaps tomorrow we can start over on better terms."
"I very much doubt it. Good night."
    -- Talia and Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Had the silly thing in reverse."
    -- Duck Dodgers in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Commander, there''s a problem. Commander?"
    -- Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Midnight on the Firing Line"
','
"Always this busy around here?"
"Yes. We like it that way."
    -- Dr. Franklin and LtCmdr. Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"If I can''t make it, you''ll have to blow up that ship before it hits."
"Why not destroy it now?"
"First contact protocol, Lieutenant Commander. Only when conditions
 present a clear and present danger. If this is a new technology,
 a new race, I want that ship intact."
"This *isn''t* a clear and present danger? I must read the rulebook again."
    -- Sinclair and Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"Send it away, while you still can."
    -- Delenn to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"No. I have been to your world. Can you feel it?"
"Feel what?"
"Low. Quick. Muffled. Terrified. It comes. It comes. It comes."
    -- Soul Hunter #1 and Franklin in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"Quick flash. The deep blue of pain."
"Dull. Muffled. Slower now. Closer now. Over your shoulder. It comes.
 The transition. A shadow. The long exhalation of the spirit. Can you
 see it, healer? Can you see it?"
"Gone. Gone now. Gone. Gone. Gone. If you could only see. If you could
 only see."
    -- Soul Hunter #1 in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"We are not thieves. We are preservers."
"I thought that might get your attention."
"We act only for the greater good."
    -- Soul Hunter #1 and Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"Minbari: pale, bloodless. Look in their eyes and see nothing but mirrors,
 infinities of reflection. Will not let us help them, no."
    -- Soul Hunter #1 in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"Minbari: jealous, selfish, private. We have saved only a few. Very rare.
 Rarest of all: their leader, Dukhat, dying. Your fault. Your war. The
 pinnacle of Minbari evolution. We came. I, others. They made a wall of
 bodies to stop us. He died .. and his dreams, his ideas .. all that he
 was, all that he could ever be .. gone, wasted. Jealous. Gone. Gone."
    -- Soul Hunter #1 to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"It''s all so brief, isn''t it? Typical human lifespan is almost a hundred
 years, but it''s barely a second compared to what''s out there. It wouldn''t
 be so bad if life didn''t take so long to figure out. Seems you just start
 to get it right and then .. it''s over."
"Doesn''t matter. If we lived two hundred years, we''d still be human.
 We''d still make the same mistakes."
"You''re a pessimist."
"I''m *Russian*, Doctor. We understand these things."
    -- Dr. Franklin and LtCmdr. Ivanova in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"And what will you do then?"
"Free them, release them."
"You mean kill them."
"They will join with the souls of all our people. Melt one into another
 until they are born into the next generation of Minbari. Remove those
 souls and the whole suffers. We are diminished. Each generation becomes
 less than the one before."
"A great lie. A pretty fantasy. The soul ends with death, unless react to
 preserve it. We *will* help you .. in spite of yourselves. I know you.
 You were there at the death of your leader Dukhat."
"We stopped you from taking what you had no right to take."
"You stopped me from saving him. That is where it began to go wrong.
 The lost souls. One after another after another. Voices still. I failed
 because you stopped me."
    -- Soul Hunter #1 and Delenn in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"I remember. They called you Satai Delenn of the Grey Council.
 Curious. Curious. What is one of the great leaders of the Minbari
 doing here playing ambassador?"
    -- Soul Hunter #1 to Delenn in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"I hate it when you get heroic. It cuts into my business.
 A man''s gotta earn a living, you know?"
    -- Garibaldi to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"You would plan such a thing? You would *do* such a thing? Incredible."
    -- Soul Hunter #1 to Delenn in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"Why do you fight for her? Don''t you understand? She is Satai. She is Satai.
 I''ve seen her soul. They''re using you. They''re *using* *you*!"
    -- Soul Hunter #1 to Sinclair about Delenn in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"We were right .. about you."
    -- Delenn to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"It can wait. There''s always time"
    -- Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"If I may ask, what happened to my brother''s collection?"
"Life''s full of mysteries. Consider this one of them."
    -- Soul Hunter #2 and Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Soul Hunter"
','
"Gentlemen, of all things in life, are females not the finest?"
"On that, Mollari, we can at least agree."
    -- Londo and G''Kar in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"I am Ko''Dath, the new head of your diplomatic staff."
"Yes. I wasn''t expecting you for several yea.. days."
    -- Ko''Dath and G''Kar in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"You know, sometimes I *almost* feel sorry for G''Kar."
    -- Londo to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"What do you want, you moon-faced assassin of joy?"
    -- Londo to Vir in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"And after spending a day dealing with Ambassador G''Kar,
 I long to sink my teeth into something .."
    -- Londo to Adira in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"What if we are seen together? What will people say?"
"They''ll say.. they''ll say Ambassador Mollari is a most fortunate man.
 We Centauri live our lives for appearances, possessions, status, title.
 These are the things by which we define ourselves. But when I look beneath
 the mask I am forced to wear, I see only emptyness. And then I think of
 you .. and I say: to hell with appearances."
    -- Adira and Londo in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"And Vir!"
"Yes, sir?"
"Don''t give away the homeworld."
    -- Londo and Vir in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"Just don''t give away the homeworld."
    -- G''Kar to Ko''Dath in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"Keep them talking. I''m going to find Londo and bring him here."
"What if he refuses?"
"Then I hurt him."
    -- Sinclair and Talia Winters in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"I''ll even seal it with a kiss."
"That should make G''Kar''s day."
    -- Londo and Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"How are we gonna find this friend of Adira''s?"
"I have a friend or two down here myself."
"I take it these are not them."
    -- Sinclair and Londo in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"

"Gold channel opened."
"All right lieutenant gremlim. This time your butt is mine."

"Oh, the gratitude of the Narn is well known throughout the galaxy."
    -- G''Kar to Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"

"I never knew you could be so devious, Commander."
"Coming from you, Ambassador, that''s a real compliment."
    -- G''Kar and Sinclair in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"My dear G''Kar. How can I ever thank you? *You* have saved my career,
 and the honor of the entire Centauri Republic."
"*What*?"
    -- Londo and G''Kar in Babylon 5:"Born to the Purple"
','
"You still haven''t told me when the commander is due back?"
"Soon."
"How soon is soon?"
"Longer than a little while, faster than later."
    -- Mary Ann Cramer and Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Infection"
','
"Commander''s a hands-on kind of guy. He''ll grab any chance to take
 out a ship. He''s like that."
    -- Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Infection"
','
"Savor the mystery, Stephen. We don''t get nearly enough of them."
    -- Vance Hendricks to Dr. Franklin in Babylon 5:"Infection"
','
"Nothing in his personnel jacket to suggest a heart condition.."
"Yes, and exactly which medical school did you attend, Mr. Garibaldi?"
    -- Garibaldi and Dr. Franklin in Babylon 5:"Infection"
','
"This is a blueprint for living machines. The Vorlons have one.
 Some people even say the Minbari have them. We haven''t seen
 enough of them up close to get any idea of how they work."
    -- Vance Hendricks to Dr. Franklin in Babylon 5:"Infection"
','
"The last time I gave an interview they told me to just relax and say what
 I really felt. Ten minutes after the broadcast I got transferred to an
 outpost so far off the starmaps you couldn''t find it with a hunting dog
 and an ouiji board."
"Don''t sweat it. Just be that charming, efflorescent commander we''ve all
 come to know and love. What''s the worst that could happen? They fire you,
 ship you off to the Rim and I get promoted to Commander. I don''t see a
 problem here."
    -- Sinclair and Garibaldi in Babylon 5:"Infection"
','
"Stephen. It''s been 15 hours. We are gonna grow old and die in here.
 Stephen? Stephen, there''s a Martian war machine parked outside.
 They''d like to have a word with you about the common cold."

 Ministry of Peace, or Minipax, as we like to call it around the office.
 We''re trying to round up support for a series of new programs we''re
 launching."

"Folks back home are awfully nervous about all the fighting going on out
 here. They need reassurance, you see? They need an environment dedicated

 it''s like nothing you can describe. And then .. just as they look past you,
 the moment that they look past you, you can''t help but meet their gaze and,
 just for an instant, you see God reflected in their eyes. I''ve seen a lot of

"As the name implies, you must also be watchful. Peace can be made or broken
 with a gun, a word, an idea, even a thought. Now, those who work *against*
 peace sow the seeds of discontent. They plant false stories, they undermine
 the public good. It''s not because they are necessarily evil. It''s because
 they don''t know any better. They''re rejected, they''re unhappy, and they lash
 out in the only way they can. So, If we could be made aware of these
 problems as they occur, then we can find these people, we can talk to these
 people, we can embrace them again in the arms of society, while, at the same
 time, protecting society from misinformation and harmful ideas. We''re less
 interested in actions than we are in attitudes. We must help protect society
 against its own worst instincts. And by taking these bold steps, we *will*
 help to ensure a better future for everyone. I''m proud to be a part of it,

 power, rebuilt them, and began to stretch forth their hand. Before they
 could strike, they were defeated by an alliance of worlds, including the
 Minbari .. and the few remaining First Ones who have not yet passed beyond

 the Shadows, maybe there are some allies we have not approached yet. Many
 times over the last million years the Shadows were fought to a stand-still
 by the First Ones, races immeasurable older than our own. After the last
 war, a thousand years ago, we believed the first ones went away forever,
 passing beyond the galactic rim, where no human or minbari has ever
 ventured. But the vorlons remained, it is possible that some of the others
 may still be around."

 is to come."

','
"Ah, for a moment I was thinking women, drinking and debauchery. I forgot I
 was speaking to a Minbari. This, by you, is a good time, is it? What else?"
"You must tell someone a secret that you have never told anyone else before.
 And you must give away something that is of great value to you."

"In the matter of confessions, meditation and the closing of past wounds,
 Ambassador, you were at the top of my list."
"I''m already attending to my past, my present and what remains of my future.
 I do not require your assistance. Or your *approval*. Enjoy your ceremony,
 Delenn. I intend to have other plans."

','
"Everything I was, everything I had, all of it died that night.
 I don''t have anything left to give."
"And that is exactly what you must give up. Yes, you have lost much, endured
 much, sacrificed greatly, but you cling to the memory of your sacrifices,
 of all the things you have lost or left behind. They *drag* behind you,
 like chains of your own making. They can have a terrible power over you,
 Marcus. The power of grief, and loss, and regret. Yes, you have let go of
 the people, the places, the things, but you have not let go of the pain.
 You have not forgiven yourself."
"For what?"
"Being alive."

"Hello. I''ll deal myself in."
"I thought we had an understanding. We don''t bother you, you don''t bother us."
"That was before a close friend of mine was abducted by some very bad people.
 Being rather bad people yourselves, it occurs to me one of you might know
 where she is."
"We don''t talk to security, why should we talk to you?"
"Because if you don''t, then in five minutes I''ll be the only person of this
 table still standing. Five minutes after that, I''ll be the only person in
 this room still standing. So, who''s in?"

"Among Minbari, one individual leads, but we move as one. We are at our best
 when we move together, and we are at our worst when we move together. When
 our leader was killed by your people, we went mad together. We stayed mad
 for a very long time, a maddness that almost consumed your world, until
 finally, before it was too late, we woke up together. But you, you are
 alone, you have no one to awaken you from your madness. For this, and
 nothing else, I feel pity for you."

"Hello Delenn. Now, I was thinking, you couldn''t come to the ceremony, the
 ceremony should come to you. I''ve given up something that really mattered
 to me, the uniform and everything that goes with it. I''ve never told anyone
 before now.. When you were hurt, when you were in my arms, I was ready to
 kill that guy with my bare hands. I realized I have never told you how much
 I cared about you, how much you mean to me. I think it''s time you knew that.
 I can no longer imagine my world .. without you in it. I don''t .. know
 exactly when or how it happened, .. but I''m glad it did."

"What do you mean, 100 credits?"
"I mean, more than 99, less than 101. What, do you have a hearing problem,
 or a math problem? Look, I can''t get into conceptual arguments with you,
 I''ve got people waiting."
"That''s three times the delivery charge for package this size."
"That was before we had a revolution around here. Now, in my little corner
 of Earth Force the mail still gets delivered. If I''ve got to use trapdoors,
 alien transports and back channels to get the mail in and out of here,
 that''s what I do, because that''s my job. Neither rain, nor snow, nor
 meteors, nor alien invasion nor.."
"Look, this is extortion."

"You know, I used to think it was awful that life was so unfair. Then I
 thought, wouldn''t it be much worse if life *were* fair, and all the terrible

 ambiguity, no .. hopeless battle against ancient and overwhelming forces.
 *They* were the bad guys, as you say, we were the good guys. And they made
 a very satisfying *thump* when they hit the floor."
"It''s wrong for the strong to prey on the weak. That idea was the very heart
 of the Round Table. To correct injustice, to promote a society of laws, not
 arms."

 Merlin was a great teacher, you know."

 me to convey his *compliments* on your hard work, even if some parts of it
 do read as if they were written by Ambassador Mollari."

 Clark isn''t calling the shots back home, there''re others whispering in
 his ear. I don''t know who they are or where they are from, but do I know
 they are not human. I have only heard one name for them: Shadows. My guess

 returned. We knew they were rebuilding their forces preparing to strike. We
 knew that they were seeking allies and that the Centauri were the first to
 enlist. When you came back from the area near Z''ha''dum, and warned us about
 the enemies'' return, we could''ve spoken out. We could''ve confirmed your
 story. We chose to remain silent."
"Who is ''we''?"
"The Grey Council. I was still a part of them at that time. Once the decision
 was made, I could not disobey."
"So you stayed silent. And with the help of these .. Shadows, the Centauri
 destroyed my world. Enslaved or killed millions of my people."
"G''Kar, if we *had* spoken out, if we *had* come public with what we knew,
 most of the other worlds would never have believed us. It would have changed
 *nothing*. Your world would still have fallen. With one critical difference.
 There are billions of Narns still surviving on your world. If we had exposed
 the Shadows, they could have struck openly before we had time to prepare,
 and *none* of your people would have survived. G''Kar, under the Centauri
 there is at least the hope of survival. With the Shadows, there is no hope
 at all. We had to choose between the death of millions and the death of
 *billions*, whole planets."

 After everything we''ve been through with your people, Sheridan was crazy to
 send our pilots out to fight for your ship. They didn''t want to go, they

 Respectfully, Delenn, I think this is the one thing about your position

 To see a human invoke the name of Valen, be willing to die for one of my
 kind when I was intent upon killing one of my own, the rightness of my
 cause disappeared. Strange, that a human in his last moments should be more
 of a Minbari than I. Perhaps it is true what Delenn said. That we are not of

 missing, he was killed by a Zarg. But I''m getting ahead of myself. That
 was after I found out that the entire 17th floor grey sector had completely
 disappeared. Well, not disappeared exactly, this weird cult had taken over
 the place, see, and there was this dummy that shot tranqs out of his eyes.
 Very strange, but it was also supposed to be perfect. Now *that* was the
 thing about it, but there wasn''t a way out, but there was, except it was
 spiritual. You had to die a perfect death, that''s where the Zarg came in

 grouchy, it said ''crotchety''. No wonder you have such an eccentric culture.
 None of your words have their own meanings, you have to look up one word to

 your constant warfare. None of which matters to G''Kar or his associates.

 think they care about that a great deal."

"When I was a child, my father used to carry me through the city on his
 shoulders. I''ve never seen such beauty. The city was eternal, its beauty
 eternal. We heard of the Grey Council, but the name was always spoken with
 awe and reverence. They held our world together. They were the peace
 promised by Valen; thousand years of peace among the three castes."

"I think of my beautiful city in flames, Lennier. The streets where I walked,
 the temples, the great crystal spires .. that sighed music whenever the wind
 touched them. I think of it, and I cry, Lennier. And I wonder: did I do this
 when I broke the Grey Council?"
"Valen always said the Council will be broken in the Great Shadow War."
"Lennier, you know the truth as well as I do. Valen only knew what
 Sinclair knew, could not see beyond that. Once he left us, the future
 became fluid. I had assumed things would continue on, like some great
 clockwork mechanism. As long as the war was won, we would be all right.
 I was wrong."
    -- Delenn and Lennier in Babylon 5:"Rumors, Bargains and Lies"

"I need your help, Neroon."
"My help? I remind you that not very long ago I fought to keep you from
 taking control of the Rangers. We have not exactly been friends."
"No, but your actions have always been motivated by one desire: to do what
 is right for our people. The warrior caste can not be allowed to win this
 war. The religious caste can not be allowed to win. You know as well as I
 that if either side achieves dominance, the delicate balance of our
 civilisation will be destroyed."

"Yes, we''ve disagreed, even fought, but I would rather have someone who
 opposed me out of an honest belief in the rightness of his cause than
 someone who was always on my side because it was expected and required.

 your loyalty."

 it makes it false. Are you with me so far?"

 your ego, .. the usual fanaticism we have come to expect from the religious
 caste. In the last year, I''ve begun to realize that I was wrong. Dukhat
 chose you above all to follow him. Slowly, dimly, I begin to understand why.
 I do not know what lays ahead of us, Delenn, but I do know it is *right*

 form a new government. Dukhat said that in every battle one side or the
 other must surrender eventually. It''s the natural order of things, There''s
 no dishonor in that, no shame. We recognize the superior forces of the
 warrior caste. We have, after all, spent several centuries arming you,
 helping you learn the art of combat. What threat are we against that?"

 through wisdom, not arms. Will we set that aside so quick?"

 is only one of the consequencies, neither valued nor feared above the other.
 Death is merely a release from our obligations. Why then are you afraid,
 Shakiri? Have you put your importance above our own people?"

"In the past it has been our tradition to seek balance. We have called
 three from each caste: worker, warrior, religious. But now that changes."
    -- Delenn in Babylon 5:"Moments of Transition"
','
"You had forgotten the worker caste, hadn''t you? When our two sides fight,
 they''re the ones caught in the middle, forgotten that it''s their time to
 serve to build, and to die. They built the temples we pray in, the ships
 you fight in. They look to us to guide their hands. But prayers are
 fleeting and wars forgotten. What is built endures. They do not wish to
 conquer or convert, only to build the future. And now, they will have that
 chance. The religious caste and the warrior caste will advise and councel.
 We will serve, as is proper. Religion and war must act in the *service* of
 the people, not the other way around. This place.. this place is reserved
 in memory of Neroon, until the day it is taken by the One who is to come.
 You are the heart, the hands, and the voice of our people. Judge wisely

"For many years all of us here have priced our good relations with Earth.
 You have shown through your example that strength comes from a multitude of
 voices brought together for a common cause. Humans form communities. In that
 spirit we have voted to dissolve the League of Non-Aligned worlds and create
 a new alliance, based on mutual co-operation and respect. An alliance, born
 in the diverse voices of many worlds, joined by their desire to build a
 better future and their decision to voluntarily recognize a common
 authority."

"Something called ''rice''."

 strange indeed. Still, they''re quite a couple, aren''t they?"

"It was the end of the Earth year 2261 and it was the dawn of a new age for
 all of us. It was the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.
 The next 20 years would see great changes, great joy and great sorrow.

 loved endures. And Babylon 5, .. Babylon 5 endures."

"What are you talking about?"
"Among my people this is how we celebrate state funerals. Our marriage
 ceremonies are solemn, sober, moments of reflection, also regret,
 disagreement, argument and mutual recrimination. Once you know it can''t

"Obviously there''s a degree of uncertainty in *any* new political situation.
 This next year will prove critical for Sheridan and the rest of his people.
 Look what they are up against: he has to ride herd on the dozen or so alien
 races that have signed on to this alliance and probably don''t fully
 understand what''s being required of them. There are still sporadic fighting
 between many of those members. On top of that, he has supply problems,
 telepath problems, raiding parties, not to mention distrust among elements
 of his own government here at home. This man has his work cut out for him,
 but I *know* that he can handle it."
    -- Senator Elizabeth Metarie in Babylon 5:"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"
','
"The first thing you have to do is separate fantasy from reality. The
 publicity machine of the Alliance would have you believe that somehow *all*
 this came about because of what a few people did. But large political
 movements are rarely the workup of any one person. The individual at the
 center gives permission for others to act, can *inspire* others. But the
 individual really can not affect changes on an act of will. *They* did not
 do, they allowed others to do."
    -- Dr. Barbara Tashaki in Babylon 5:"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"
','
"We all have a profound psychological need to believe in heroes, the shining
 knight on the white horse. If they don''t exist, we create them. Sheridan
 and Delenn are two classic examples. If you look at the social dynamic around
 them, they actually didn''t do anything. They were the open vessels in which
 people poured their hopes and their dreams. That sets up sort of a gestalt,
 where events take on a life of their own."

 You''re one of those people who rehearses everything, Mr. Garibaldi. You
 never enter a situation until you''ve gone over it and over it a hundred
 times, worked out what you will say and what the other person will say,
 how you''ll respond. It''s .. quite remarkable and extremely depressing.

"--the other way, maybe you could--"
"Yeah, you''re right."
"Why don''t you just *ask* somebody?"
"No, no. I''ve got a map. Don''t worry about that."
"What is it with you men?"
"Here we go."
"Are you sure you know where we''re going?"
"Yes, it''s the .. same hotel that .. Michael stayed at.
 Said the room service is good and bed is cheap and staff is friendly."
"Meaning the food stinks, the rooms are small and the staff will knife
 you in the back when you''re not looking."
"Exactly. All right, I think it''s .. it''s that way."

"Hello, Mollari."
"Regent?"
"I told you we would speak again before the end. I always try to keep my
 promises, especially to those who have been kind to me .. as you have been."
"It is no burden. Regent, I have been trying to see you for some time.
 Our ships--"
"Yes. .. I know."
"Then you gave the order."
"After a fashion. I have always tried to do the right thing, *you* know,
 when circumstances allowed."
"We all do, Regent."
"Yes. And now it is your time. Mine is almost over. I have to say, I''ll be
 glad of it. I''m so tired of it all, Londo. I''m glad .. I won''t live to see
 what follows."
"Why? What is going to follow?"
    -- Regent and Londo in Babylon 5:"Movements of Fire and Shadow"

"What do you mean there weren''t any crew aboard?"
"Garibaldi said that there were two seperate Centauri fleets engaged in the
 war: one defensive, one offensive, that no one in the Centauri military
 knew anything about the attacks, only that they were defending themselves
 against us. Now we know why."
    -- Sheridan and Franklin in Babylon 5:"Movements of Fire and Shadow"

"This is leftover Shadow technology, Mr. President. Vorlons gave me
 information on them in case I ever ran across one of them. And I understand
 a few years ago one was found by the Psi Corps. It''s an organic device used
 to control a ship from a long distance. You put two or three of these on
 board a starship and .. you don''t even need a crew."
    -- Lyta to Sheridan in Babylon 5:"Movements of Fire and Shadow"
','
"It''s going to be a pretty night, the last one I will ever see."
"You shouldn''t talk that way, Regent. You still have many years
 ahead of you. That''s why it''s important to recall the ships. We can still
 make peace."
"Oh, there will be peace, for a while. It never lasts, really. They said so.
 They said two things, actually. That there will be peace and that it won''t
 last. They also said I would be dead by morning and that tomorrow .. you
 will be emperor. They said many, many things. Things I didn''t want to hear.
 Things I didn''t understand. And things I didn''t *want* to understand."
"They? Who are *they*, Regent?"
"Oh, you will find out for yourself soon enough, Londo. You shouldn''t rush
 your last *free* hours. And there were something else they told me .. to do.
 And I did it just a few moments before I came to see you. The last thing I
 will ever have to do for them. And in a way .. I''m glad it''s over."
"What did they ask you to do?"
"To send away all the ships .. guarding Centauri Prime on a false emergency
 and turn off the planetary defense network."
"No!"
"I think I''ll stay .. and watch from here. The sky should be lighting up any
 time now. I imagine .. it will be .. quite beautiful."
"*No!*"

"It is said that the future is always born in pain. The history of war is the
 history of pain. If we are wise, what is born of that pain matures into the
 promise of a better world, because we learn that we can no longer afford the
 mistakes of the past."

"No, she''s always quiet. We think maybe there''s something wrong with her."
"Yes .. or something very right. The quiet ones are the ones that change the
 universe, Luc Derardi. The loud ones only take the credit."

"Then let them appear, to give us something to believe in. If the Vorlons
 do not see the danger, then perhaps the danger does not exist."

"Yes, they should, but if the legends surrounding the Vorlons are correct,
 remember that they do not reveal themselves quickly and never all at once."
"What are you saying?"
"I''m not saying anything. I didn''t say anything then, and I''m not saying
 anything now."
    -- Dukhat and Delenn in Babylon 5:"In the Beginning"

"Are you saying I''m being deceived?"
"I''m not saying anything. I did not say anything then, and I''m not saying
 anything now. Unless you are saying you''ve seen a Vorlon."
"I''m saying even less than you, except for this. When the darkness comes,
 if you ever have doubt about your actions, all you need do is look into
 the face of a Vorlon. Once you see that, all doubt is erased forever."
    -- Dukhat and Delenn in Babylon 5:"In the Beginning"

"Why do you come here, Delenn?"
"I come to serve."
"Who do you serve?"
"I serve the truth."
"What is the truth?"
"That we are one people, one voice."
"Will you follow me into fire? Will you follow me into darkness?
 Will you follow me into death?"
"I will."
"Then follow."

"They say we''ll need allies. In particular, a race that is so far unknown to
 us called humans. If we have not already done so by now, it is my hope that
 you will work with the Vorlons to find these humans and bring them into the
 battle on our side."

"Humans?"
"Yes. They are the key."

"And if the only way out is for Earth to surrender?"
"Officially that''s up to the negotiators. Those are my orders. Unofficially..
 We''re losing this war, John. And if the only way the human race can survive
 is to surrender.. then we will surrender."

"The humans, I think, knew they were doomed. Where another race would
 surrender to despair, the humans fought back with even greater strength.
 They made the Minbari fight for every inch of space."

 is a final assault on their world, we must know their defenses."
